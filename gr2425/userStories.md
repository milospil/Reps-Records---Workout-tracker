## Essential functionality

**As a user, I want to create a new workout so that I can easily repeat it many times**

The user needs to be able to create a new workout. The user must be able to name the workout, select the type, and choose the intensity. Once the name, type, and intensity are set, the user must be able to specify the exercises they want to include in the workout. For each exercise, the user should be able to name the exercise, give it a purpose, select the mechanics, and choose the force. It’s beneficial to reuse exercises. Therefore, the user needs a list of previously saved exercises that can be added to the workout.

## Product backlog

- As a user, it is necessary that my data is saved to my user, so I can log in to another device and not lose my progression.

- As a user, I would like to be able to add a session, so I can track my exercises and save them in the app.

- As a user, I want the option to repeat a saved session, because this will save me time and I dont have to make and save the same session every time.

- As a user, I might perform exercises in the gym that is not already registered in my app. Therefore, I need to have the option of having my own exercise database, where I can add and remove exercises.

- As a software developer, I would like to save and load data from/to file in the same format, so it is easy to work with.

- As a workout interested user, I would find it motivating to get a graph over my completed workouts, so it is easier to get an overview over my progression.

- As a user, I would like to have the option of removing exercises from my workout session. Because I might have missclicked the wrong exercise when adding one to my session.

- As a user, the whole purpose of having a workout logger app is to record my workouts. Therefore, I need to be able to record the weight and reps I do in my exercise sets.

- As a user that trains often, I would like to favourite my exercises that I use often, so it is easier to add exercises to my new workouts.

- As a user, I might not know exactly how to technically perform an exercise or what muscle it targets. Such an implementation would be appreciated.

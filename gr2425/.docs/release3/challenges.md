# Challenges

Our project to create an application for the IT1901 course has been a consistently positive and valuable learning experience. From the start, we focused on good communication and building an inclusive team environment to create a strong foundation for learning and development. We believe that enjoying one's work environment leads to better performance, and when team members feel comfortable with one another, it becomes easier to ask for help and less intimidating to make mistakes. This positive environment has made the project enjoyable and rewarding for us all.

Even though we’ve had a strong culture of sharing and a good atmosphere in the group, we’ve also faced some challenges. The two main challenges were the difficulty of collaborating effectively and the complexity of handling a large codebase. As students, we only had two required days per week for in-person meetings, and if this were a full-time job, some of these challenges might have been easier to manage.

In a project like this, where each person has their own way of solving problems, it’s hard to collaborate when we don’t have much time to work together in person. Although we worked well together, it was challenging to write tests for, and improve, code we hadn’t written ourselves. Since we’re still gaining experience as developers, it was naturally difficult to work together on a project of this size, even though we tried to keep the codebase organized and readable. The size of the project also added complexity, making it hard to know when we could reuse existing code versus when we needed to write new code for similar functionality. This meant that we sometimes spent extra time implementing features that could have been achieved by reusing code. Additionally, the many dependencies across files made it challenging to keep track of everything, which made it harder to get help from others, from online resources, or from tools like ChatGPT.

As the project progressed and grew in size and complexity, it became increasingly challenging to understand each other’s code. We recognized these issues early on and implemented pair programming, with a stronger focus on code reviews and merge requests, to keep everyone aligned. We also made an effort to meet outside scheduled times for additional collaboration. We also created different UML diagrams in the second and third release that has increased the conseptual overview, but this could have been created earlier, maybe even before starting implementing code, as a part of the planning process.

These experience have taught us that even with strong efforts to promote collaboration, team development comes with both rewarding and challenging aspects. It is difficult to collaborate in a team and the learning curve is steep, but it is very rewarding.
